## Authentication (TypeScript, Node/Express, Prisma)

Authentication API built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, and MySQL, featuring secure user signup and login with bcrypt password 
hashing and JWT authentication. The project follows clean architecture practices with controllers, middleware, and error handling, and is tested 
using Postman for API validation.
